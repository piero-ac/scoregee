    <details class="question">
        <summary>Will Scoregee be accessible on mobile?</summary>
        <div>
          At this moment, Scoregee doesn't have an app to be accessed
          on a mobile device. Only on computer at this time.

    <details class="question">
        <summary>Will there be a sign in page?</summary>
        <div>
          The sign in page is a work in progress. At a later time, it'll
          be made, in which you can create an account, and sign into 
          your individual account.

    <details class="question">
        <summary>What's the perks of having a Scoregee account?</summary>
        <div>
          You'll be able to pick your favorite teams and track what
          days that they play.

    <details class="question">
        <summary>Why does Scoregee only track soccer? Why not other sports?</summary>
        <div>
          We only have time to implement soccer scores at this
          time. Once we're done with soccer we're open to tracking other
          sports like basketball, football, and more.
