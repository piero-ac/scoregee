    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <details class="question">
        <summary>Will ScoreGee be accessible on mobile?</summary>
        <div>
          At this moment, Scoregee doesn't have an app to be accessed
          on a mobile device. Only on computer at this time.
        </div>
    </details>
    <details class="question">
        <summary>Will there be a sign in page?</summary>
        <div>
          The sign in page is a work in progress. At a later time, it'll
          be made, in which you can create an account, and sign onto 
          your individual account. 
        </div>
    </details>
    <details class="question">
        <summary>What's the perks of having a ScoreGee account?</summary>
        <div>
          You'll be able to track soccer scores of your favorite team(s) from 
          the past or present.
        </div>
    </details>
    <details class="question">
        <summary>Why does Scoregee only track soccer? Why not other sports?</summary>
        <div>
          We only have time to implement soccer scores at this
          time. Once we're done with soccer we're open to tracking other
          sports like basketball, football, and more.

        <details class="question">
          <summary>Will ScoreGee connect to platforms in order to watch
            the game?
          </summary>
          <div>
            No. At this time ScoreGee only provides scores and not where or
            how to watch that particular game.
