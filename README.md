## Description

This project draws inspiration from LiveScore.com. We wanted to create our version of this website using data obtained from API-Football. Project was made during the Spring 2023 semester for CPS4951 - Senior Capstone.

### Technologies

<ul>
<li>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS</li>
<li>Backend: NodeJS, Express, Axios</li>
<li>Database: MongoDB, Mongoose</li>
<li>API: API-Football https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3</li>
</ul>

### Current Version Specific Information

This version of the project continues to use a MongoDB database stores information for over 7000 matches and over 100 teams.
Currently, due to the design of API-Football, we aren't able to obtain lineup information for multiple matches at once. Therefore, it was not possible to store that information in the database for all of the matches. Displaying a match's information currently requires an API call that slows done page loading time.

### To-Do

<ul>
<li> Improve Website Visuals </li>
<li> Create scripts to periodically update fixture information </li>
</ul>
